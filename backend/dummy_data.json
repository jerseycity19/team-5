            "story": "My drug use started when I was in high school, with pain pills that I was prescribed. After some time, I developed a high tolerance, and had to take more and more of them at a time to even feel high. I've struggle so much through the years to stay off the opiates. It wasn't until I admitted complete defeat and surrendered my life to my higher power that, I was able to see that I was bound by the disease of addiction. On October 25, 2017 I was able to get into a detox program at Santa Maria Hostel. I currentyly attend 12-step meetings, and attend therapy as well as stay connected with my support team. Today I am 22 months clean and sober and work as a Recovery Coach with the Youth. I get the opportunity to share my lived experience with others daily. WE DO RECOVER!.",
